## Abstracts from Vanderbilt Broadcast TV News Archives 

We provide scripts to scrape and parse the Vanderbilt Broadcast TV News Archives and link to a dataset that includes both the raw files and the parsed data. 

### Final Dataset

Our final parsed dataset is at the program segment level. Each `program` has multiple `broadcast` segments. Each `broadcast` segment gets its own row. The dataset has the following columns:

`date, program_title, program_duration, broadcast_title, broadcast_duration, broadcast_time, broadcast_order, broadcast_abstract, reporter(s)`

#### Data Dictionary

`reporter(s)`: For instance, for this [broadcast](https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/broadcasts/16), the reporters are: Cosell, Howard; Reynolds, Frank

`broadcast_time`: For instance, for https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/programs/1, the broadcast time for `WORLD SERIES / MCLAIN / GIBSON #16` is `12:20:40 am â€” 12:22:50 am`

`broadcast_order`: For instance, for https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/programs/1, the broadcast time for `WORLD SERIES / MCLAIN / GIBSON #16` is `16`

`broadcast_abstract`: Actual text of the broadcast without the header or footer. 

### Scraping

We start from the [site index](https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/siteindex). And then download all the month-year pages.

The `program` and `broadcast` pages rely on a simple counter. So we iterate over all program and broadcast pages. There are a total of 1,119,648 broadcast pages.

We then parse the data to produce the CSV. 

When there is no relevant `broadcast` page, we leave the `broadcast_abstract`, `reporter(s)` fields empty.

## Testing

To make sure, we downloaded all the files, we spot checked existence of various files and compared actual number of links to actual number of files.

## Scripts

[The scripts](vandy/vandy) to scrape and parse are written in Python as a spider using the Scrapy framework.

### Installation

We strongly recommend installing `vandy` inside a Python virtual environment (see [venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments))

    pip install scrapy
    git clone https://github.com/soodoku/vandy_tv_news_abstracts.git

### Run the spider

To scrape all the broadcasts:

    cd  vandy_tv_news_abstracts/vandy
    scrapy crawl vandy_news -o vandy.csv -t csv --loglevel INFO

or you may filter the spider to a specific month using the filter argument:

    cd  vandy_tv_news_abstracts/vandy
    scrapy crawl vandy_news -a filter=2019-11 -o 2019-11.csv -t csv --loglevel INFO

## Final Data

Final data is posted at [Harvard Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BP2JXU)

* Raw HTML (`html-vandy.tar.bz2.parta*`)
    To joined them to a file please run ```cat html-vandy.tar.bz2.parta* > html-vandy.tar.bz2```
* Final CSV (`vandy.csv`)

The Scrapy HTTP cache (`httpcach-vandy.tar.bz2`) is also posted. Please extract it to `.scrapy` under the `vandy` folder. Then the spider can use the webpages from the cached data if you don't want to get the live data from the website.
